# Mini_Pokedex (SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project)

This is a catalog website I made for Snap Academy 2024 (SEA) Stage 2 project assessment. As a Pokemon fan, I created the Pokedex where you can explore and learn about Pokemons.

I am really passionate about this project, and so proud with what I implemented!

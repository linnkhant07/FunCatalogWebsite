# Mini_Pokedex (SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project)

This project is a 'catalog' website designed to mimic the functionality of a Pokedex, allowing users to explore and learn about different Pokemons. I developed it for the Snap Academy 2024 (SEA) Stage 2 project assessment.

I am really passionate about this project, and so proud with what I implemented!

## Data Structures Used

- Arrays
- Objects

## Features

These are the data operations you can perform with each pokemon (array entry).

### Filtered

Pokemons can be filtered according to their types.

### Sorting

Pokemons can be sorted according to their stats and Id (either low to high or high to low)

### Searching

Users can search Pokemons with their names.

### Deleting

Pokemons can be released (deleted), and they will be forever gone from the array! The user is not able to find the Pokemon again through any type of filter, sort or search.

### Favorite Property

Users can toggle any Pokemon as their favorite. These favorite Pokemons can be checked with the sort button "Favorites".
